# Pac-Man World 2 Archipelago

## What does randomization do to this game?
- Locks the ability to play levels with the `Progressive Level` item.
- If you do not have enough `Progressive Level`s, the client will send a warning log and prevent you from sending out checks.

## What is the goal of Pac-Man World 2 when randomized?
- Beat the final level depending on the `total_levels` setting.

## Which items can be in another player's world?
- `Progressive Level` to unlock the next level
- `Token` is a mcguffin. You need to collect however many you set the `token_goal` yaml setting to.

## What are the locations in Pac-Man World 2?
- By default, every fruit and level completion are locations.
- You can enable time trials, tokens, or pac-dots for extra locations.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?
- If it is a `Progressive Level`, the client will check if you have enough to play the next level and will allow you to send checks out for the next location.
- If it is a `Token`, the client will update and once you reach enough tokens, you can send out checks on the final level.

## Notes and Limitations
- There is 1 initial warning log about progressive levels when opening the game due to how the game is structured.
